              In 1949, the first model of a motorcycle with a two-stroke engine
              Soichiro called ‘The Dream’. Two years later he started the
              production of a model with four-stroke engine. And by 1958, when
              his model of “Super Cub” model came to the U.S., Honda was already
              the largest Japanese manufacturer of motorcycles, leaving behind

            <h4>1973</h4>
            <p>
              In 1973, Honda Motor Co., Inc. celebrated its 25th anniversary.
              During the board of directors meeting, dedicated to this event,
              Soichiro Honda declared that he was going to retire. The new
              president, as expected, was chosen from among the employees. The
              founding father was fond of saying that the company thrives when
              its former chief appears there as seldom as possible. So his
              departure from the office was final.

            <h4>1975</h4>
            <p>
              Having reached the top in the motorcycle industry, Honda decided
              that now he can proceed with the implementation of a cherished
              dream - to create automobiles. One of the first attacks, Soichiro
              Honda took on the problem of exhaust gases. None of the world’s
              car automakers could not handle it directly, and solved it by
              creating a catalytic converter. And only Honda was able to design
              the first engine with a low pollution level. This environmentally
              friendly device he installed to Honda Civic model that was
              launched into production in 1975 and quickly gained immense
              popularity.
